[]{#_Toc362874862 .anchor}Purpose:

Accelerate the communications training of flight testers. Desired end
state is a flight test team who can safely, securely, effectively, and
efficiently communicate with each other, whether over the radio or
face-to-face.

[]{#_Toc362874863 .anchor}Method:

Introduce **brevity codes** in their proper context, AFTTP(I) 3-2.5 (Feb
2002), to reduce the confusion of misused brevity and to leverage rated
aircrews' operational training. The AFTTP(I) 3-2.5 brevity codes most
applicable to flight test are shown in Appendix A, with the definition
and the flight test context included. Codes most often misused are
indicated with an asterisk (\*) and an explanation of how to avoid
misuse.

Develop a general approach to **Flight Test Brevity** to enhance test
conduct quality and inform test teams' communication plans. Appendix B
contains Flight Test Brevity terms. Each entry states the term, and its
definition. Typical errors associated with each term are also shown, as
well as the effects of the error and a "plain English antidote" to be
used if brevity breaks down.

[]{#_Toc362874864 .anchor}Introduction:

**"Brevity codes"** are short, standard phrases used in operational
radio communications to maximize information content while minimizing
time spent transmitting (keying the microphone) and receiving (wondering
what they guy just said).

For the United States armed forces, brevity codes are defined in the
document "BREVITY -- Multiservice Brevity Codes"[^1] with the Air Force
document designation of AFTTP(I) 3-2.5. The February 2002 version is
unclassified and publicly releasable.

**"Flight Test Brevity"** is a more general approach to test team
communications (comm) that uses the principles of brevity codes, does
not misuse official brevity codes, and defines specific words to be used
in a communications plan for a particular test mission.

Properly used, brevity can assist flight test conduct because there is
direct correlation between proper communications and test conduct
quality, as shown in Table 1.

[]{#_Ref361918789 .anchor}Table 1. Correlation Between Test Conduct
Quality and Proper Communications

  Test Conduct Quality   Proper Communication
  ---------------------- ----------------------
  Safe                   Correct
  Secure                 Concise
  Effective              Complete
  Efficient              Clear

[]{#_Toc362874865 .anchor}The Principles of Brevity:

AFTTP(I) 3-2.5 does not contain all of the words required for test
conduct, but it is an important document for establishing the principles
of brevity and for avoiding misuse of official terms.

**Principle 1 - Contracts**

One of the strengths of brevity is the coupling of a code with
pre-arranged roles and responsibilities, or "contracts." A given code,
when broadcast, is always associated with a particular role, reducing
the amount of time required for identifying the transmitter and intended
receiver. A given code also updates or confirms the responsibilities of
the transmitter and the receiver.

BREVITY EXAMPLE: TACO 02: "TACO 02 is IN RIGHT"\
TACO 01: "PRESS"

PLAIN ENGLISH EXAMPLE: TACO 02: "TACO 01, TACO 02, I'm going to engage
with the target that I had been previously assigned by making a sharp
turn to the right, therefore I'll no longer be able to stay visual with
you, so you need to make sure you don't run into me and keep scanning
for other threats."

TACO 01: "TACO 02, TACO 01, as Flight Lead, I'm directing you to
continue your attack as stated in your transmission. I will continue to
scan for other threats, while preventing your target from obtaining the
advantage over you. I will also not run into you."

In the above example, notice that the wingman, "Taco 02," and flight
lead, "Taco 01," did not have to identify himself, could use
single-syllable words, "IN" and "PRESS," to communicate current and
future actions, as well as changes to responsibilities for separation
and support.

**Principle 2 - Only Three Types of Brevity Code**

Brevity codes can be sorted by their intent, as shown in Table 2. This
sorting is important, because it shows the three types of brevity code:
directive, informative, and requesting.

[]{#_Ref361922423 .anchor}Table 2. The Three Brevity Code Types

  Type          Intent                                                      Examples
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- --------------
  Directive     I am telling you to do something                            "HOOK LEFT"
  Informative   I am describing something to you                            "WINCHESTER"
  Requesting    I am requesting information AND you are expected to reply   "PICTURE"

The bottom line is this: if you aren't directing, informing or
requesting, then you're not using brevity, you're having a discussion.

**Principle 3 - Standard Word Count**

Some brevity codes are standalone and some are always accompanied by
other words, as shown in Table 3. This distinction is important, because
it sets the expectation of how many words should constitute a radio
call. If the number of words doesn't match expectations, confusion may
ensue.

[]{#_Ref361923276 .anchor}Table 3. Word Count in Brevity Codes

  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Word Count                  Examples
  --------------------------- -------------------------------
  Standalone                  "MADDOG"\
                              "LINE ABREAST"

  Standard Additional Words   "CHECK (number, left/right)"\
                              "(system) BENT"
  -----------------------------------------------------------

[]{#_Toc362874866 .anchor}Brevity...A Small Part of the Comm Plan:

Part of the test engineer's responsibility is to establish and use a
communications plan during test conduct.

The primary purpose of the comm plan is to create a "cadence" to the
test flow, allowing the test team to anticipate the next step, then
execute that step at the right time and right place with the right
actions. If the comm plan is poorly briefed and/or understood, the
execution of the test will suffer because of the difficulty of
establishing an understanding of what is to be done, by whom, when and
where.

Brevity can assist the comm plan by reducing the "chatter" on the radio,
allowing the test team to focus on action, rather than communication.

Brevity is NOT the most important part of a comm plan, however!
Referring back to Table 1, you can see there is a priority order. Always
remember that plain English (AKA "Trucker Comm") is sometimes necessary
to safely execute, but you should NEVER "talk around" classified over
the radio.

[]{#_Toc362874867 .anchor}Creating a Comm Plan:

**Defining your terms** is the foundation of a good comm plan. Test team
members come from varied backgrounds. The mission materials and the
pre-flight brief are the last opportunity to get everyone on the same
page. A non-exhaustive listing of definition priorities is shown in
Table 4.

[]{#_Ref362274138 .anchor}Table 4. Priority of Term Definitions

+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+

|                            |                            |          |

+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+
| Callsigns                  | "Test" v "Taco 01"         | Medium   |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+
| Plain English              | "Fly a normal pattern" v   | Low      |
| "Happy-to-Glad"            | "Establish a normal        |          |
|                            | pattern"                   |          |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+

**Identifying the types of test points** provides the structure of a
good comm plan. Some test missions consist of a single type of test
point, necessitating a single, repeated comm plan. Other test missions
have many types of test points, necessitating a carefully laid out comm
plan, which clarifies which test point type is being flown for each test
point.

**Scripting the plan** is essential to ensure the test team has an
objective reference for planning and briefing purposes. Include pacing
when appropriate, for example during weapons deliveries pauses might be
inserted into the countdown to allow for team members to call for
aborts. Also consider the role of hot mic, which tends to reduce brevity
on the part of the aircrew while the ground controllers are still
constrained by radio communications, as well as reduced/partial comm
situations, where portions of the test team cannot participate in the
comm as briefed.

Keeping brevity in mind is the finishing touch of a good comm plan.
Brevity takes a comm plan to the next level, but the foundation and
structure are more important! So, when you get to the point of scripting
your plan, only after defining your terms and identifying test point
types, apply the three principles of brevity:

1)  **Contracts** - At each step of the comm plan, know who is
    responsible for speaking next.

2)  **Three Types** - Ensure your words accurately reflect whether the
    responsible party is:

    a.  Directing -- "Cleared to..." "Check..."

    b.  Informing -- "Next point is..." "Point complete..."

> or

c.  Requesting -- "Ops check..." "Confirm..."

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3)  **Standard Word Count** - Use words in accordance with the brief and
    the mission materials

[]{#_Toc362874868 .anchor}Using the Comm Plan:

The key to establishing a cadence during test execution is consistency.
Say the same thing at the same time to build test team confidence and to
help reinforce the impression that the test mission is proceeding under
control.

When inconsistencies creep in, they are a sign that something has
changed. It may be as simple as fatigue, or it may be a serious system
problem. Bring the test team back to the comm plan, if there are no
safety-of-flight or test concerns. If there are problems to be resolved,
be explicit about the plan of action and the exit criteria from the
troubleshooting.

Example: "We are reviewing the data. If we can't find the cause in the
next 5 minutes, we'll stop testing and return to base."

Remember, you're either using the comm plan, or you're having a
discussion. Make sure the entire test team is clear on where you are in
your communications.
