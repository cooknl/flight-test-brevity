    "text": "2.1 Principle 1 - Contracts\nOne of the strengths of brevity is the coupling of a code with pre-arranged roles and responsibilities, or “contracts.” A given code, when broadcast, is always associated with a particular role, reducing the amount of time required for identifying the transmitter and intended receiver. A given code also updates or confirms the responsibilities of the transmitter and the receiver.\n\nBREVITY EXAMPLE\nTACO 02: “TACO 02 is IN RIGHT”\nTACO 01: “PRESS”\n\n\nPLAIN ENGLISH EXAMPLE\nTACO 02: “TACO 01, TACO 02, I’m going to engage with the target that I had been previously assigned by making a sharp turn to the right, therefore I’ll no longer be able to stay visual with you, so you need to make sure you don’t run into me and keep scanning for other threats.”\nTACO 01: “TACO 02, TACO 01, as Flight Lead, I’m directing you to continue your attack as stated in your transmission. I will continue to scan for other threats, while preventing your target from obtaining the advantage over you. I will also not run into you.”\n\n\nIn the above example, notice that the wingman, “Taco 02,” and flight lead, “Taco 01,” did not have to identify themselves, and used single-syllable words, “IN” and “PRESS,” to communicate current and future actions, as well as changes to responsibilities for separation and support."

This is because there are phases of test execution when a third-party is primarily responsible for clearance (often critical phases such as engine start, taxiing, takeoff, departure, aerial refueling, approach, and landing). There are other phases of test execution where the test team must decide and clarify who is responsible for clearance. The specifics of the test point should be the primary consideration, including how static or dynamic the point is.\n\n\nTable A.10: Clearance Brevity Codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearance\nBrevity Code\nDefinition\nFlight Test Context\n\n\n\n\nCLEAR(ED)◬\nResponse to requested action is authorized. No engaged/support roles are assumed.\nTest point pacing ONLY.\nDO NOT SAY “CLEARED” WHEN A/C IS ABOUT TO TAXI, TAKE THE RUNWAY, OR LAND.\nThe “cleared” word is reserved in those situations for the controlling agency (ground, tower, etc.). Don’t get your aircrew violated because they acted without clearance from the controlling agency!\n\n\nCLEARED HOT◬\nOrdnance release is authorized.\nNOT FOR THE TEST CONDUCTOR TO SAY! Range control has the hammer.\n\n\nCONTINUE\nContinue present maneuver, does not imply a change in clearance to engage or expend ordnance.\nVERY USEFUL. By replying to an aircrew query with “CONTINUE”, you are indicating that you are aware of the situation, you’ve taken it into consideration, and they can safely, securely, effectively, and efficiently proceed with the current course of action.\n\n\nCONTINUE DRY\nOrdnance release not authorized.\nNOT FOR YOU TO SAY!\n\n\nPRESS◬\nDirective call to continue the attack; mutual support will be maintained. Supportive role will be assumed by the speaker.\nNot typically used in flight test conduct, but a very common term in informal settings.\n\n\nPUSH (channel)\nGo to designated frequency; no acknowledgment required.\nNot for you to say, but the flight lead is directing the flight to change frequencies, so follow along.\n\n\nRESET\nProceed to a pre-briefed position or AO.\nStart over, per the brief.\n\n\nRESUME\nResume last formation/route/mission ordered. If test point was paused, resume at last step.\n\n\n\nROGER◬\nIndicates the receipt of radio transmission; does not indicate compliance or reaction.\nOne of the more abused brevity codes. Only indicates that you heard, nothing more. “ROGER, COPY” is redundant, as is “ROGER, WILCO.”\n\n\nROLEX (+/- Time)\nTime line adjustment in minutes always referenced from original preplanned mission execution time. Plus means later; minus means earlier.\nOften used when delays have offset brief mission times.\n\n\nSAUNTER\nFly at best endurance.\nUsed when test is on hold.\n\n\nSKIP IT\nVeto of fighter COMMIT, usually followed with further directions.\nUsed to veto aircrew suggestion or to tell aircrew NOT TO PICKLE.\n\n\nUNABLE\nCannot comply as requested or directed.\nUsed to indicate inability to comply.\n\n\nWEAPONS ( )\n\nFREE\nTIGHT\nHOLD◬ (USAF, USA,USMC)\nSAFE◬ (USN)\n\nFire only:\n\nAt targets not identified as friendly IAW current ROE.\nAt targets positively identified as hostile IAW current ROE.\nIn self-defense or in response to a formal order.\n\nWeapons testing.\n\n\n\n\nFlight Condition codes provide low-fidelity generalizations of altitude and airspeed. They can be very useful when tight tolerances and databands are not required, but a general condition is desired. They do not often have test-specific meanings, but test teams can make use of the test aircrew and operators prior training to provide clarity and reduce communication bandwidth.\n\n\nTable A.11: Flight Condition Brevity Codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlight Condition\nBrevity Code\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nVERY FAST\nTarget speed greater than 900 knots ground speed or Mach 1.5.\n\n\nFAST\nTarget speed is estimated to be 600 – 900 knots ground speed or Mach 1.0 – 1.5 .\n\n\nSLOW\nContact with ground speed of less than 300 knots.\n\n\nVERY HIGH\nTarget above 40,000 ft MSL.\n\n\nHIGH\nContact is between 25,000 and 40,000 ft MSL.\n\n\nMEDIUM\nContact altitude between 10,000 ft MSL and 25,000 ft MSL.\n\n\nLOW\nContact altitude below 10,000 ft MSL.\n\n\nWEEDS\nIndicates that aircraft are operating close to the surface.\n\n\n\n\nRules of Engagement (ROE) & Identification (ID) codes provide characterizations of the friend/foe status, as well as free/restrained weapons engagements can be. They do not often have test-specific meanings, but test teams can make use of the test aircrew and operators prior training to provide clarity and reduce communication bandwidth.\n\n\nTable A.12: Rules of Engagement & ID Brevity Codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROE & ID\nBrevity Code\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nDECLARE\nInquiry as to the identification of a specified track(s), target(s), or correlated GROUP.\n\n\nID\n\nDirective call to identify the target.\nInformative call that identification is accomplished, followed by type.\n\n\n\nDescriptions\n\n\n\nBANDIT\nAn aircraft identified as an enemy in accordance with (IAW) theater ID criteria. The term does not necessarily imply direction or authority to engage.\n\n\nBOGEY\nA radar or visual air contact whose identity is unknown.\n\n\nCHICKS\nFriendly aircraft, typically used for aircraft on the tanker.\n\n\nFRIENDLY\nA positively identified friendly aircraft, ship, or ground position.\n\n\nHOSTILE\nA contact identified as enemy upon which clearance to fire is authorized in accordance with theater rules of engagement.\n\n\nOUTLAW\nInformative call that a BOGEY has met point of origin criteria for ROE.\nPoint of Origin means that the contact came from a geographic location identified as hostile.\n\n\nPAINT(S)\nAn interrogated group/radar contact that is responding with any of the specified IFF/SIF modes and correct codes established for the ID criteria.\n\n\nPRINT (type)\nActive NCTR reply.\n\n\nSPADES\nAn interrogated group/radar contact which lacks all of the ATO (or equivalent) IFF/SIF modes and codes required for the ID criteria."

In this standard terminology, “safe” is defined as avoiding loss or damage to persons or property.\nIn Dr. Leveson’s framework, unsafe and hazard are more broadly defined in terms of team-defined losses. All four of the standard flight test objectives can be defined in terms of losses:\n\nSafe = avoiding loss of persons or property or loss of their utility\nSecure = avoiding loss of advantage over an enemy\nEffective = avoiding loss of test objective completion\nEfficient = avoiding loss of time and resources beyond that required to meet test objectives\n\nTherefore, the four ways a control action can be unsafe do apply to all four of the flight test objectives, even though only one is called “safe.”"

    "text": "C.2 Translated to flight test communications\nVoice communication is one type of control action. With a small modification, substituting “statement” for “control action,” the four ways provide a useful heuristic for assessing communication errors.\nThe four ways a statement can lead to loss:\n\nNot providing the statement\nProviding an incorrect statement\nProviding a statement too early, too late, or in the wrong order\nThe statement lasts too long or not long enough\n\n\nC.2.1 Omission: Not providing the statement\nWhen a statement is required, but not provided, several consequences can follow.\nThe shared mental model among the test team can drift. The test aircrew can enter an unsafe condition without awareness. The control room team can proceed to the next test point unaware of an issue on the air vehicle.\nTrust between team members can deteriorate. The communications plan is a contract, and adherence to it builds confidence that the team is functioning well. Deviation from the plan, especially unacknowledged deviations, can reduce confidence, even to the point of discontinuing the test.\n\n\nC.2.2 Negation: Providing an incorrect statement\nWhen an incorrect statement is provided, it can cause an immediate schism in mutual understanding. This is especially true if the statement is made confidently and with full trust of all team members. This can directly and actively lead to a loss of situational awareness.\nAgain, trust can deteriorate, especially if the incorrect statement was made mistakenly, and other team members recognize the issue.\nIn any case, significant time and resources can be expended until the incorrect statement is acknowledged by all team members, and a correct statement appropriate for the new context can be subsituted.\n\n\nC.2.3 Succession: Providing a statement too early, too late, or in the wrong order\nThis is about sequencing of the statement.\nIn flight test, timing and cadence can be very important. Whether it be weapon delivery, avionics inputs, flight control inputs, formation maneuvers, or many others, the proper timing and succession of actions is imperative.\nStatements communicating directives, information, or requests can directly influence the sequence of events.\n\n\nC.2.4 Duration: The statement lasts too long or not long enough\nSomething as simple as holding the transmit button on a one-way radio the wrong duration can induce losses. Too long, and others are prevented from passing their own statements. Too short, and the required statement may be cut off.\nBrevity itself is an attempt to make a statement last no longer than required, but no shorter, either.\n\n\n\n\nLeveson, Nancy G. 2012.

Some test missions consist of a single type of test point, necessitating a single, repeated comm plan. Other test missions have many types of test points, necessitating a carefully laid out comm plan, which clarifies which test point type is being flown for each test point.\n\n\nE.2.3 Scripting the plan\nA clear and common script is essential to ensure the test team has an objective reference for planning and briefing purposes. Include pacing when appropriate, for example during weapons deliveries pauses might be inserted into the countdown to allow for team members to call for aborts. Also consider the role of hot mic, which tends to reduce brevity on the part of the aircrew while the ground controllers are still constrained by radio communications, as well as reduced/partial comm situations, where portions of the test team cannot participate in the comm as briefed.\n\n\nE.2.4 Brevity takes it from good to great\nKeeping brevity in mind is the finishing touch of a good comm plan. Brevity takes a comm plan to the next level, but the foundation and structure are more important! So, when you get to the point of scripting your plan, only after defining your terms and identifying test point types, apply the three principles of brevity:\n\nContracts - At each step of the comm plan, know who is responsible for speaking next.\nThree Types - Ensure your words accurately reflect whether the responsible party is:\n\nDirecting – “Cleared to…” “Check…”\nInforming – “Next point is…” “Point complete…”\nRequesting – “Ops check…” “Confirm…”\n\nStandard Word Count - Use words in accordance with the brief and the mission materials"
