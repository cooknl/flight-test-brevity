The multiservice brevity codes most applicable to flight test are shown in Appendix B, with the definition and the flight test context included.\nThis guide develops a general approach to Flight Test Brevity to enhance test conduct quality and inform test teams’ communication plans. Appendix A contains Flight Test Brevity terms. Each entry states the term, and its definition.

    "text": "2.1 Principle 1 - Contracts\nBREVITY does not contain all of the words required for test conduct, but it is an important document for establishing the principles of brevity and for avoiding misuse of official terms.\nOne of the strengths of brevity is the coupling of a code with pre-arranged roles and responsibilities, or “contracts.” A given code, when broadcast, is always associated with a particular role, reducing the amount of time required for identifying the transmitter and intended receiver. A given code also updates or confirms the responsibilities of the transmitter and the receiver.\nIn the above example, notice that the wingman, “Taco 02,” and flight lead, “Taco 01,” did not have to identify themselves, and used single-syllable words, “IN” and “PRESS,” to communicate current and future actions, as well as changes to responsibilities for separation and support.",

    "text": "B.11 Clearance Codes\nClearance codes have significant potential for miscommunication. This is because there are phases of test execution when a third-party is primarily responsible for clearance (often critical phases such as engine start, taxiing, takeoff, departure, aerial refueling, approach, and landing). There are other phases of test execution where the test team must decide and clarify who is responsible for clearance.

Used to provide approval to aircraft to continue the pass without expending ordnance during Type 1, 2, or 3 control.

Only indicates that you heard, nothing more. “ROGER, COPY” is redundant, as is “ROGER, WILCO.”\n\n\nROLEX [time]\n{I} Timeline adjustment in minutes for entire mission; always referenced from original preplanned mission execution time; always means later.

    "text": "C.1 4 ways control actions can be unsafe\nDr. Nancy Leveson, in Engineering a Safer World (Leveson 2012) and the STPA Handbook (Leveson and Thomas 2018), draws on systems theory to describe the importance of control actions in a complex system. An unsafe control action is a control action that, in a particular context and worst-case environment, will lead to a hazard.\nThere are four ways a control action can be unsafe:\nThere is some overlap in terminology between the standard flight test objectives: safe, secure, effective, efficient. In this standard terminology, “safe” is defined as avoiding loss or damage to persons or property.\nIn Dr. Leveson’s framework, unsafe and hazard are more broadly defined in terms of team-defined losses. All four of the standard flight test objectives can be defined in terms of losses:\nTherefore, the four ways a control action can be unsafe do apply to all four of the flight test objectives, even though only one is called “safe.”",

    "text": "C.2 Translated to flight test communications\nVoice communication is one type of control action. With a small modification, substituting “statement” for “control action,” the four ways provide a useful heuristic for assessing communication errors.\nThe four ways a statement can lead to loss:\n\nNot providing the statement\nProviding an incorrect statement\nProviding a statement too early, too late, or in the wrong order\nThe statement lasts too long or not long enough\n\n\nC.2.1 Omission: Not providing the statement\nWhen a statement is required, but not provided, several consequences can follow.\nThe shared mental model among the test team can drift. The test aircrew can enter an unsafe condition without awareness. The control room team can proceed to the next test point unaware of an issue on the air vehicle.\nTrust between team members can deteriorate. The communications plan is a contract, and adherence to it builds confidence that the team is functioning well. Deviation from the plan, especially unacknowledged deviations, can reduce confidence, even to the point of discontinuing the test.\n\n\nC.2.2 Negation: Providing an incorrect statement\nWhen an incorrect statement is provided, it can cause an immediate schism in mutual understanding. This is especially true if the statement is made confidently and with full trust of all team members. This can directly and actively lead to a loss of situational awareness.\nAgain, trust can deteriorate, especially if the incorrect statement was made mistakenly, and other team members recognize the issue.\nIn any case, significant time and resources can be expended until the incorrect statement is acknowledged by all team members, and a correct statement appropriate for the new context can be subsituted.\n\n\nC.2.3 Succession: Providing a statement too early, too late, or in the wrong order\nThis is about sequencing of the statement.\nIn flight test, timing and cadence can be very important. Whether it be weapon delivery, avionics inputs, flight control inputs, formation maneuvers, or many others, the proper timing and succession of actions is imperative.\nStatements communicating directives, information, or requests can directly influence the sequence of events.\n\n\nC.2.4 Duration: The statement lasts too long or not long enough\nSomething as simple as holding the transmit button on a one-way radio the wrong duration can induce losses. Too long, and others are prevented from passing their own statements. Too short, and the required statement may be cut off.\nBrevity itself is an attempt to make a statement last no longer than required, but no shorter, either.\n\n\n\n\nLeveson, Nancy G. 2012.

If the comm plan is poorly briefed and/or understood, the execution of the test will suffer because of the difficulty of establishing an understanding of what is to be done, by whom, when and where.\nBrevity can assist the comm plan by reducing the “chatter” on the radio, allowing the test team to focus on action, rather than communication.\nBrevity is NOT the most important part of a comm plan, however!\nReferring back to Table 1.1, you can see there is a priority order.

Some test missions consist of a single type of test point, necessitating a single, repeated comm plan. Other test missions have many types of test points, necessitating a carefully laid out comm plan, which clarifies which test point type is being flown for each test point.\n\n\nE.2.3 Scripting the plan\nA clear and common script is essential to ensure the test team has an objective reference for planning and briefing purposes. Include pacing when appropriate, for example during weapons deliveries pauses might be inserted into the countdown to allow for team members to call for aborts. Also consider the role of hot mic, which tends to reduce brevity on the part of the aircrew while the ground controllers are still constrained by radio communications, as well as reduced/partial comm situations, where portions of the test team cannot participate in the comm as briefed.\n\n\nE.2.4 Brevity takes it from good to great\nKeeping brevity in mind is the finishing touch of a good comm plan. Brevity takes a comm plan to the next level, but the foundation and structure are more important! So, when you get to the point of scripting your plan, only after defining your terms and identifying test point types, apply the three principles of brevity:\n\nContracts - At each step of the comm plan, know who is responsible for speaking next.\nThree Types - Ensure your words accurately reflect whether the responsible party is:\n\nDirecting – “Cleared to…” “Check…”\nInforming – “Next point is…” “Point complete…”\nRequesting – “Ops check…” “Confirm…”\n\nStandard Word Sequence - Use words in accordance with the brief and the mission materials",
