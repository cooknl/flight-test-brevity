# Test Run Flow {#sec-runflow}

## The problem

Common Test Conduct Errors:

- Omitted or improperly timed communication
- Poor transitions between test runs

### Hypothesis {.unnumbered}

A causal factor in both successful and error-prone test conduct is the understanding (or misunderstanding) of where and when critical phases of a test run begin and end.

Which begs the question, what ARE the "critical phases of a test run"?

## A Test Point

![A Quantum of Test](./images/test-run-run.png){#fig-testrunrun}

The smallest unit of flight test comprised of a beginning, a middle, and an end.

## Maneuver

![Where The Data Live](./images/test-run-maneuver.png){#fig-testrunmaneuver}

The actions of the operator and the system that generate data to support a test objective

## Setup

![Preparation for Test](./images/test-run-setup.png){#fig-testrunsetup}

The actions of the operator and the system that establish the conditions for a successful Maneuver, including geometry, geography, system state, etc.

## Recover

![Return to Normal Operations](./images/test-run-recover.png){#fig-testrunrecover}

The actions of the operator and the system that safely allow resumption of “normal” operations.

## Admin

![A Change of State](./images/test-run-admin.png){#fig-testrunadmin}

The actions of the operator and the system before the test, between test runs, or after the test.

## Transitions

![“Pauses”](./images/test-run-transitions.png){#fig-testruntransitions}

The gates from one critical phase to the next that establish the cadence of the test.

## The structure approach

For each test run, the test team 

- **defines** the contents of each critical phase,
- **determines** entry and exit criteria through the transitions,
- **creates** a communications plan to support the transitions, and
- **creates** mission materials to assist in test conduct

## Application to test card creation

![Top to Bottom Test Point Flow on Test Card](./images/test-run-card.png){#fig-testruncard}

Each test card reflects the critical phases of the test run under consideration.

![Multiple Test Points on a Single Test Card](./images/test-run-multiple.png){#fig-testrunmultiple}

Multiple test runs can be put on a single page! The recover/admin/setup phases between each run are explicitly included, instead of just a string of Maneuver phases.

## Application to Comm Plan

![Exit and Entry Criteria](./images/test-run-exit-entry.png){#fig-testrunexitentry}

::: {layout="[60,40]"}

1. Test: “Ready for next run”
2. Control: “Cleared to \[condition/configuration\]”
3. Test: “On conditions”
4. Control: “Cleared to maneuver”
5. Test or Control: “Maneuver complete/Recover(ing)”
6. Control: “Cleared to \[condition/configuration\]”
7. Test: “On conditions/Configuration complete/Recovered”
8. Control: “Point complete. Next run is X at Y”

- Odd = Exit
- Even = Entry
- The Key to Success:
  - The test team defines **the content and duration** of each critical phase and 
  - identifies **exit and entry criteria** for the transitions between phases
