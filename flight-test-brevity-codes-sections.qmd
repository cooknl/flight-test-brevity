## RADIO CHECK

### Correct Usage {.unnumbered}

-   "RADIO CHECK"
-   "RADIO CHECK ON \[channel\]"

### Meaning {.unnumbered}

-   "RADIO CHECK"
    -   I'm requesting that you tell me how well you can hear my transmission on the PRIMARY or MAIN channel.\
-   "RADIO CHECK ON \[channel\]"
    -   I'm requesting that you tell me how well you can hear my transmission on the explicitly stated channel.

### Typical Errors {.unnumbered}

-   Calling for a "RADIO CHECK" from a channel other than PRIMARY or MAIN.
-   Calling for a "RADIO CHECK ON \[channel\]" from a channel other than that explicitly stated

### Effects of Errors {.unnumbered}

Aircrew think you're calling on a channel that you're not calling from, and provides a RADIO CHECK on that erroneous channel, leading to a "false positive" or "false negative."

### Plain English Antidotes {.unnumbered}

- "How do you hear me on \[channel\]?

## READY

### Correct Usage {.unnumbered}

"\[Transmitting callsign\] IS READY \[for taxi/takeoff/point X/etc\]"

### Meaning {.unnumbered}

The sender is ready to support test as soon as clearance is obtained for the next administrative step (taxi, takeoff, etc.), or as soon as the receiver acknowledges with "\[Receiving callsign\] IS READY"

### Typical Errors {.unnumbered}

1. "CLEARED TO \[action for which the sender has no authority or responsibility such as TAXI, TAKEOFF, LANDING, etc.\]" 2. "…" (aka crickets)

### Effects of Errors {.unnumbered}

1.  Receiver begins action without proper coordination and/or clearance.
2.  Aircrew are wondering what's going on.

### Plain English Antidote {.unnumbered}

1.  "\[Transmitting callsign\] is showing all necessary steps complete and is prepared for \[receiving callsign\] to \[take action\]"
2.  Say something/anything.

##@
"-        Saying “CLEARED TO MANEUVER” way too early, i.e. prior to setup, instead of clearing the aircrew to a setup flight condition to prepare for the actual maneuver.
-        Saying “CLEARED TO MANEUVER” way too late, i.e. the aircrew are waiting and burning gas, or they’ve already begun the maneuver without your clearance."
"-        Confusion ensues about if the test point has actually begun, if aircrew are on parameters, or if clearance has already been issued, requiring a conversation.
-        TC loses control of the mission and the trust/confidence of the aircrew because aircrew have gone rogue, not wanting to burn gas and time waiting for your clearance."
“We are on test point XX. We show good setup. The control room is ready. You are cleared to maneuver.”
