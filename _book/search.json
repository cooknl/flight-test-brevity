The February 2002 version is unclassified and publicly releasable.\n“Flight Test Brevity” is a more general approach to test team communications (comm) that\n\nuses the principles of brevity codes,\ndoes not misuse official brevity codes, and\ndefines specific words to be used in a communications plan for a particular test mission.\n\nProperly used, brevity can assist flight test conduct because there is direct correlation between proper communications and test conduct quality, as shown in Table 1.1.\n\n\nTable 1.1: Correlation Between Test Conduct Quality and Proper Communications\n\n\nTest Conduct Quality\nProper Communication\n\n\n\n\nSafe\nCorrect\n\n\nSecure\nConcise\n\n\nEffective\nComplete\n\n\nEfficient\nClear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBREVITY Multiservice Brevity Codes. 2002.

    "section": "2.1 Principle 1 - Contracts",
    "text": "2.1 Principle 1 - Contracts\nOne of the strengths of brevity is the coupling of a code with pre-arranged roles and responsibilities, or “contracts.” A given code, when broadcast, is always associated with a particular role, reducing the amount of time required for identifying the transmitter and intended receiver. A given code also updates or confirms the responsibilities of the transmitter and the receiver.\n\nBREVITY EXAMPLE\nTACO 02: “TACO 02 is IN RIGHT”\nTACO 01: “PRESS”\n\n\nPLAIN ENGLISH EXAMPLE\nTACO 02: “TACO 01, TACO 02, I’m going to engage with the target that I had been previously assigned by making a sharp turn to the right, therefore I’ll no longer be able to stay visual with you, so you need to make sure you don’t run into me and keep scanning for other threats.”\nTACO 01: “TACO 02, TACO 01, as Flight Lead, I’m directing you to continue your attack as stated in your transmission. I will continue to scan for other threats, while preventing your target from obtaining the advantage over you. I will also not run into you.”\n\n\nIn the above example, notice that the wingman, “Taco 02,” and flight lead, “Taco 01,” did not have to identify themselves, and used single-syllable words, “IN” and “PRESS,” to communicate current and future actions, as well as changes to responsibilities for separation and support."

    "text": "Brevity…A Small Part of the Comm Plan:\nPart of the test engineer’s responsibility is to establish and use a communications plan during test conduct.\nThe primary purpose of the comm plan is to create a “cadence” to the test flow, allowing the test team to anticipate the next step, then execute that step at the right time and right place with the right actions. If the comm plan is poorly briefed and/or understood, the execution of the test will suffer because of the difficulty of establishing an understanding of what is to be done, by whom, when and where.\nBrevity can assist the comm plan by reducing the “chatter” on the radio, allowing the test team to focus on action, rather than communication.\nBrevity is NOT the most important part of a comm plan, however! Referring back to Table 1, you can see there is a priority order. Always remember that plain English (AKA “Trucker Comm”) is sometimes necessary to safely execute, but you should NEVER “talk around” classified over the radio.\nCreating a Comm Plan:\nDefining your terms is the foundation of a good comm plan. Test team members come from varied backgrounds. The mission materials and the pre-flight brief are the last opportunity to get everyone on the same page. A non-exhaustive listing of definition priorities is shown in Table 4.\nTable 4. Priority of Term Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms\nExamples\nPriority\n\n\n\n\nEmergency/Anomalies\nKnock-It-Off\nAbort\nTerminate\nHighest\n\n\nSwitch Actuations\n“Designate” v “TMS FWD”\nHigh\n\n\nManeuvers\nSuccess Criteria\n\n\n\nChase/Target Responsibilities\nSafety v Photo v Area\n\n\n\nCallsigns\n“Test” v “Taco 01”\nMedium\n\n\nPlain English “Happy-to-Glad”\n“Fly a normal pattern” v “Establish a normal pattern”\nLow\n\n\n\nIdentifying the types of test points provides the structure of a good comm plan. Some test missions consist of a single type of test point, necessitating a single, repeated comm plan. Other test missions have many types of test points, necessitating a carefully laid out comm plan, which clarifies which test point type is being flown for each test point.\nScripting the plan is essential to ensure the test team has an objective reference for planning and briefing purposes. Include pacing when appropriate, for example during weapons deliveries pauses might be inserted into the countdown to allow for team members to call for aborts. Also consider the role of hot mic, which tends to reduce brevity on the part of the aircrew while the ground controllers are still constrained by radio communications, as well as reduced/partial comm situations, where portions of the test team cannot participate in the comm as briefed.\nKeeping brevity in mind is the finishing touch of a good comm plan. Brevity takes a comm plan to the next level, but the foundation and structure are more important! So, when you get to the point of scripting your plan, only after defining your terms and identifying test point types, apply the three principles of brevity:\n\nContracts - At each step of the comm plan, know who is responsible for speaking next.\nThree Types - Ensure your words accurately reflect whether the responsible party is:\n\nDirecting – “Cleared to…” “Check…”\nInforming – “Next point is…” “Point complete…”\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nRequesting – “Ops check…” “Confirm…”\n\n\n\nStandard Word Count - Use words in accordance with the brief and the mission materials\n\nUsing the Comm Plan:\nThe key to establishing a cadence during test execution is consistency. Say the same thing at the same time to build test team confidence and to help reinforce the impression that the test mission is proceeding under control.\nWhen inconsistencies creep in, they are a sign that something has changed. It may be as simple as fatigue, or it may be a serious system problem. Bring the test team back to the comm plan, if there are no safety-of-flight or test concerns. If there are problems to be resolved, be explicit about the plan of action and the exit criteria from the troubleshooting.\nExample: “We are reviewing the data. If we can’t find the cause in the next 5 minutes, we’ll stop testing and return to base.”\nRemember, you’re either using the comm plan, or you’re having a discussion. Make sure the entire test team is clear on where you are in your communications."
