# Introduction

**"Brevity codes"** are short, standard phrases used in operational radio communications to maximize information content while minimizing time spent transmitting (keying the microphone) and receiving (wondering what the guy just said).

For the United States armed forces, brevity codes are defined in the document "*BREVITY -- Multiservice Brevity Codes*" [@http://zotero.org/users/7103471/items/HVKQ4CHY] with the Air Force document designation of AFTTP(I) 3-2.5. The February 2002 version is unclassified and publicly releasable.

**"Flight Test Brevity"** is a more general approach to test team communications (comm) that 

1. uses the principles of brevity codes, 
1. does not misuse official brevity codes, and 
1. defines specific words to be used in a communications plan for a particular test mission.

Properly used, brevity can assist flight test conduct because there is direct correlation between proper communications and test conduct quality, as shown in @tbl-correlation.
