		"abstract": "1. Purpose\nThis publication will improve coordination and understanding during multi-Service operations. A brevity code is a code which provides no security but which has as its sole purpose the shortening of messages rather than the concealment of its\ncontent.\n2. Scope\nThis publication standardizes air-to-air (A/A), air-to-surface (A/S), surface-to-air (S/A), surface-to-surface (S/S), maritime air, and maritime to maritime brevity\ncodes regardless of communication medium (voice/chat), as well as brevity codes (abbreviations) specific for use in tactical chat. The scope is limited to\nthose brevity codes used in multi-Service operations and does not include words unique to single-Service operations. All Services agree to these brevity code\nmeanings. These brevity codes have been forwarded to the NATO Standardization Office (NSO) terminology custodian for inclusion or modification of current joint brevity words in APP-7 and other appropriate Allied\nCommunications Publications.\n3. Applicability\nThis publication is intended for air, land, maritime, and space personnel conducting operations at the tactical level.",
