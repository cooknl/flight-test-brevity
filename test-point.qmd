# Test Point Flow

## The problem

Common Test Conduct Errors:

- Omitted or improperly timed communication
- Poor transitions between test points

### Hypothesis {.unnumbered}

A causal factor in both successful and error-prone test conduct is the understanding (or misunderstanding) of where and when critical phases of a test point begin and end.

Which begs the question, what ARE the "critical phases of a test point"?

![Structured Approach to Test Point Flow](./images/test-point.png){#fig-testpoint}

## A Test Point

![A Quantum of Test](./images/test-point-point.png){#fig-testpointpoint}

The smallest unit of flight test comprised of a beginning, a middle, and an end.

## Procedure

![Where The Data Live](./images/test-point-procedure.png){#fig-testpointprocedure}

The actions of the operator and the system that generate data to support a test objective

## Setup

![Preparation for Test](./images/test-point-setup.png){#fig-testpointsetup}

The actions of the operator and the system that establish the conditions for a successful Procedure, including geometry, geography, system state, etc.

## Recovery

![Return to Normal Operations](./images/test-point-recovery.png){#fig-testpointrecovery}

The actions of the operator and the system that safely allow resumption of “normal” operations.

## Admin

![A Change of State](./images/test-point-admin.png){#fig-testpointadmin}

The actions of the operator and the system before the test, between test points, or after the test.

## Transitions

![“Pause” Points](./images/test-point-transitions.png){#fig-testpointtransitions}

The gates from one critical phase to the next that establish the cadence of the test.

## The structure approach

For each test point, the test team 

- **defines** the contents of each critical phase,
- **determines** entry and exit criteria through the transitions,
- **creates** a communications plan to support the transitions, and
- **creates** mission materials to assist in test conduct

## Application to test card creation

![Top to Bottom Test Point Flow on Test Card](./images/test-point-card.png){#fig-testpointcard}

Each test card reflects the critical phases of the test point under consideration.

![Multiple Test Points on a Single Test Card](./images/test-point-multiple.png){#fig-testpointmultiple}

Multiple test points can be put on a single page! The recovery/admin/setup phases between each point are explicitly included, instead of just a string of Procedure phases.

## Application to Comm Plan

![Exit and Entry Criteria](./images/test-point-exit-entry.png){#fig-testpointexitentry}

::: {layout="[60,40]"}

1. Test: “Ready for next point”
2. Control: “Cleared to \[condition/configuration\]”
3. Test: “On conditions”
4. Control: “Cleared to maneuver”
5. Test or Control: “Maneuver complete/Recover(ing)”
6. Control: “Cleared to \[condition/configuration\]”
7. Test: “On conditions/Configuration complete/Recovered”
8. Control: “Point complete. Next point is X at Y”

- Odd = Exit
- Even = Entry
- The Key to Success:
  - The test team defines **the content and duration** of each critical phase and 
  - identifies **exit and entry criteria** for the transitions between phases
